ansible-role-kubectl
====================

Installs kubectl command line utility used to interact with the Kubernetes API Server.

Versions
--------

I tag every release and try to stay with [semantic versioning](http://semver.org). If you want to use the role I recommend to checkout the latest tag. The master branch is basically development while the tags mark stable releases. But in general I try to keep master in good shape too. A tag `r1.0.0_v1.8.0` means this is release 1.0.0 of this role and it's meant to be used with Kubernetes version 1.8.0. If the role itself changes `rX.Y.Z` will increase. If the Kubernetes version changes `vX.Y.Z` will increase. This allows to tag bugfixes and new major versions of the role while it's still developed for a specific Kubernetes release.

- r1.0.2_v1.8.0 - update default kubectl to v1.8.0
